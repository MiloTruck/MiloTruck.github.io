Hi, I'm MiloTruck, a student from Singapore. I regularly participate in Competitive Programming and Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions. Usually, I play CTFs under **HATS SG** and participate in other competitions with **ItzyBitzySpider**. I also work on other projects in my free time and have an interest in cybersecurity.
